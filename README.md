## Getting Started  

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x  
- pip (Python package manager)  
- Command prompt or terminal with administrator privileges  

### Installation  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone <repository_url>  
   cd smart-parking  
   ```  

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended for managing dependencies):  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv [environment_name]  
   ```  

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:  
   - On Windows:  
     ```bash  
     [environment_name]\Scripts\activate.bat  
     ```  
   - On macOS/Linux:  
     ```bash  
     source [environment_name]/bin/activate  
     ```  

4. **Install dependencies**:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

   **Note**: Ensure you are running your command prompt or terminal as an administrator to avoid permission issues.  

5. **Create a project directory** (optional):  
   ```bash  
   mkdir [project_directory_name]  
   cd [project_directory_name]  
   ```  

## Usage  

Once all dependencies are installed and your environment is set up, you can start the development server:  

```bash  
python manage.py runserver  
```
